## Case  
Karen Doe profile  
Karen wants a website where she can easily upload and manage recipes.

### Goal  
Create a website where Karen is free to easily upload her recipes and manage them.
Easy and cheap hosting.  


## Introduction  
Because Karen wanted to publish and share her recipes easily, we were thinking something like WordPress would be a good solution.
We wanted to make it easy and intuitive for her to add these recipes, and manage her own website, but at the same time, WordPress was more of a monolithic CMS, which we didn't want.
After some researching on different development tools and platforms, we found that GraphCMS/Hygraph was a solid alternative to WordPress, as well as replacing the back end with NextJS.

We would build it with the newest technologies such as React JS, NextJS, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL and GraphCMS.

### Why?
* We wanted easy production builds
* We wanted server-side rendering
* Static exporting options
* GraphCMS/Hygraph replaced the CMS part of WordPress
* GraphQL replaced both SQL and NoSQL but still keeping their respective benefits
* Read more below on _Pros_

### Pros vs Cons
**Pros**
* Easy to use for both the client and the developer
* The GraphQL syntax is not so different from JSON
* Hygraph acts as both a Headless CMS and a powerful GraphQL database
* Delivers performance and scalability with the available features
* Offers a free plan

**Cons**
* Cost money for bigger or more projects
* We have yet to figure out more cons...
